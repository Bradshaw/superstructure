# Welcome to my example website

This website is built with [Superstructure](https://npmjs.com/package/superstructure), an opinionated website builder for blog-ish websites!
It's the technology [Gaeel](https://github.com/Bradshaw) uses to make [spaceshipsin.space](https://spaceshipsin.space)

Articles are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and inserted into a layout written in [Pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) and styled with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).  
Metadata about the article can be defined in little [YAML](https://yaml.org/) chunk at the end.

The articles are all listed together on the [/posts](/posts) page.  
Articles have tags, which are browsable on the [/tags](/tags) page.
